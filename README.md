# Team12_Small-Molecule-Solubility-Prediction
This repository is created for CHE1147 team 12 Machine Learning project, small molecule solubility prediction. The main project objective is to develop a ML model capable of producing accurate predictions on a small molecule's solubility in different solvents and under different temperatures. The small molecule chosed in this project was flutamide, and three ML regression models were developed and trained to predict flutamide solubility in various binary organic solvents under different temperatures. A linear regression model served as the baseline, and one random forest and XGBoost models were used as the actual production models.
